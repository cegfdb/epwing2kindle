## Process description

![Process flowchart](images/flowchart.svg)

In order to convert an EPWING dictionary to kindle, you have to follow the process displayed above: first you convert the EPWING to a stardict format (TAB-separated), then using tab2opf you can convert it to opf (html) dictionary and then generate a mobi file using kindlegen.

## Usage guide

### 1. Install the requirements

- [python 3.6 or higher](https://www.python.org/)
- [yomichan-import](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan-import/)
- [kindlegen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211)


You can use either pip or [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) to install the python requirements:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

### 2. EPWING to JSON (yomichan)

```
./yomichan-import
```
[Yomichan-import](https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan-import/) is a great app that utilizes [zero-epwing](https://github.com/FooSoft/zero-epwing) to convert EPWING data into much more easily parseable JSON files.

**Note for Windows users**: Because zero-epwing does not support non-ASCII characters (like the Japanese ones), yomichan-import won't work if you have any of them in your CATALOGS path. It should work just fine on unix systems.

### 3. JSON to Tab (yomi2tab)
```
(Unix)    python3 yomi2tab.py -o mydict.tab yomi_output/
(Windows) py -3 yomi2tab.py -o mydict.tab "C:\YOUR_PATH_HERE\yomi_output"
```

Yomichan-import generates an archive file that you have to unzip into a folder (called `yomi_output` in the above example) for `yomi2tab` to work. You can also use the `./yomi2tab.py -h` flag to see all possible usage options.

### 4. Tab to OPF (tab2opf)

```
(Unix)    python3 tab2opf.py mydict.tab
(Windows) py -3 tab2opf.py mydict.tab
```

Running this command will create a folder called `opf/` that will contain the opf/html dictionary you can use in the next step.

This repository provides a japanese-specific tab2opf tool with some improvements (adding progress indicators, correct display of `<`/`>`, etc.). It is based on https://github.com/apeyser/tab2opf by Alexander Peyser from 2015 which itself is based on the generally available tab2opf.py by Klokan Petr P≈ôidal (www.klokan.cz) from 2007.

### 5. OPF to mobi (kindlegen)

```
kindlegen opf/mydict.opf
```

In order to generate a .mobi dictionary from OPF, you can use a tool called [kindlegen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211) that's provided by amazon. It may take a while to convert everything but doesn't require any extra work.

After you've generated a .mobi dictionary, you can import it into [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com) to edit the metadata, add a cover picture and send it to kindle.

## Todo

*PR's are welcome!*

- [x] Convert EPWING dictionary to kindle
- [x] Proper formatting, newlines are rendering as they should be
- [x] \(mostly) Optional "Simple" mode without old ways to write a word that use outdated kana
- [x] Support kanji when the entry is formatted as `[Kanji/Hiragana]Katakana[K/H]`
- [x] Multiple entries for the same word (not merging all of the definitions into one; official kindle dictionaries function in this way)
- [x] Tested with Â§ßËæûÊûó
- [ ] Add a zsh/python script for processing everything automatically
- [ ] Better sorting for multiple entries
- [ ] Test more dictionaries
- [ ] Improve performance (low priority)
- [ ] Make it possible to look up suffixes (stuff like -Â•Ω„Åç; low priority)
- [ ] Make it possible to look up phrases with `=` in their key (It's probably another weird EPWING thing; low priority)

*Note*: this process was tested using „Çπ„Éº„Éë„ÉºÂ§ßËæûÊûó, using it with other dictionaries like Êñ∞ÊòéËß£ÂõΩË™ûËæûÂÖ∏ should still work but some unexpected problems may arise. If you manage to successfully import another dictionary using this repo, please add a photo of your final result to the images folder via a pull request.


## Another way to convert epwing

We can also use the noj format as an intermediary between the EPWING dictionary and the tab file.

**Steps:**

1. https://github.com/mcho421/noj_dumpers
	*  Don't bother with compiling it because won't work, just copy your files to the noj_dumper folder and then `python2 noj_dumper.py epwing_folder`
2. https://github.com/asika/noj2tab (you can try reading the Chinese blog post with google translate)
3. Tab2Opf (mine or https://github.com/apeyser/tab2opf)
4. kindlegen + calibre


## Miscellaneous

### Something isn't working!

Open an [issue](https://github.com/olety/epwing2kindle/issues) on github, I'm checking this page quite regularly and will respond as soon as I can.

Also, please check closed issues before opening a new one, maybe your problem was already solved there.

### Kindlegen is throwing weird warnings!

If it actually produces a .mobi file at the end those warnings can be ignored; try putting the resulting dictionary on your kindle first and check if you can look up words. If not, open an [issue](https://github.com/olety/epwing2kindle/issues) :)

### I'm on Windows and having trouble installing the python requirements

Check issue [#1](https://github.com/olety/epwing2kindle/issues/1) - you may have to install [Build Tools for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017) to get everything working.

### Why would you ever do this? Kindle offers free builtin dictionaries!

„Éá„Ç∏„Çø„É´Â§ßËæûÊ≥â provided with Kindle doesn't have pitch accent marks.
